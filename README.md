# ECE421 Winter 2020
This repository includes all the labs in ECE421 from Winter 2020 at University of Toronto.

* Lab 1: Linear and Logistic Regression
* Lab 2: Neural Networks
* Lab 3: Unsupervised learning and probabilistic models

Please do not copy any code directly from this repo under any circumstances(e.g. last minute of the deadline), since doing so would result in Academic Misconduct. You should only consider the general approaches to the problems on high level and implement them through your own code. Hope that you can get helped here!
